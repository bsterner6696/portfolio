					<p>My name is Benjamin Sterner and this is a site dedicated to my coding projects.  It also functions as a blog of sorts, with the main page being where my blog posts will be.</p>

						<h3>This Site</h3>
						<p>On today, my third day at DevCodeCamp, I was tasked with making this website.  This was actually the most difficult task for me, because I ended up way overthinking things and spending a couple hours trying to learn code that I realized I could just as easily do with html and what I know now.  I think I finally am getting the hang of columns, and rows, and containers, and all that junk.  I also learned how to make a navbar for this website, which looks really nice.  I'm quite happy with this site.  Still kind of peeved about having trouble with the flash video on the other one though.</p>
