						<h3>Command Line And Batch Files </h3>
						<p>On our second day we worked with command line.  I have some previous experience with command line, in videogame modding, but obviously not very extensive.  We were given an example piece of code that is used to add two numbers together.  I used this code to learn how to write variables, as well as additional commands that I learned how to use online.  We were tasked with creating a batch file that creates a new user on your pc, a batch file that combines two text files together, and finally, a batch file that creates a new user but prompts for the required information.  I have a link to the github repository with those files <a href="https://github.com/bsterner6696/battingpractice">here</a>.</p>
