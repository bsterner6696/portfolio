					<p>My name is Benjamin Sterner and this is a site dedicated to my coding projects.  It also functions as a blog of sorts, with the main page being where my blog posts will be.</p>

						<h3>My First (and Second Website)</h3>
						<p>We began the course by learning html and css.  We were tasked with making a 4 page website on one of our favorite hobbies, and I chose to do mine on art.  My 4 pages were the homepage, where I introduced myself, and a page about digital painting, pencil and charcoal, and poetry.  I ended up finishing my site early so I added a sitemap page as well.  The link to my finished site is <a href="https://bsterner6696.github.io/Artsite/index.html">here</a>.  I also ended up starting on a second site, which is linked <a href="https://bsterner6696.github.io/websiteVoid/">here</a>.  This site is not finished however, as I am having some difficulty with the flash embed.</p>
