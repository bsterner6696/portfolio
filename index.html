					<p>My name is Benjamin Sterner and this is a site dedicated to my coding projects.  It also functions as a blog of sorts, with the main page being where my blog posts will be.</p>

						<h3>My First Blog post</h3>
						<p>This is my first post on this blog.  I am nearly done with my 3rd day of DevCodeCamp, and so far I enjoy the learning environment.  I like fast-paced, they tell me it will get even faster, which I am excited for.  I have more than enough faith in my ability to handle whatever they throw at me.</p>

						<h3>I FIXED IT</h3>
						<p>As I mentioned on two of my project pages, I was having trouble getting the flash video to load for me in my site.  As I finished building this site early, I just spent a couple hours working on that problem.  And I feel really stupid, the issue had nothing to do with my code, my adblocker was flagging the flash video and keeping it from loading.  So that was a big waste of my time.  I added a message to the page that only shows when the video doesn't load which tells you to disable your adblock.  It's a neat video, so I think it's worth it.  I'm just happy I figured it out, that was going to really bug me otherwise.</p>
